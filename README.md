## Introduction
Gameflix, a sports-centric OTT platform specializing in live sports broadcasts, has launched a promotional campaign targeting the Indian market.

This project endeavors to evaluate the impact of these promotional strategies on subscriber engagement, merchandise sales, and viewership.

## Approach to the Problem
### 1. Understand the Data
Before diving into analysis, it’s essential to thoroughly understand the data tables and schema provided in the project. Review data definitions, assess data quality, and comprehend relationships between variables.

### 2. Data Transformations
Converting raw data into user-centric granularity involves extracting, processing, and organizing data from tables like raw_engagement, raw_viewership, and raw_merchandise. This transformation includes joining tables with promo_metric data using user_id as a reference point to accurately analyze activities during the promo plan period.

**What constitutes the Promo Plan Period?**
The Promo Plan Period is defined as the duration between the Redemption Date and Active_to Date specified by Gameflix India Pvt Ltd, during which user engagements are considered.

### 3. Creating Story with Data Visualization Techniques
Once data transformation is complete, the focus shifts to creating a Power BI dashboard to address concerns raised by the leadership team.

#### Key Concerns of Leadership:
1. **Promo Effectiveness Assessment:**
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of each promo plan based on conversion percentage to identify the plan with the highest conversion rate.
   - Identify the promo plan with the second highest revenue per user in merchandise.
   
2. **Engagement and Behavior Analysis:**
   - Determine the month with the highest number of promo plan opt-ins to understand user engagement.
   - Identify the promo plan with the second highest average viewership per user.
   
3. **User Acquisition and Demographics:**
   - Quantify which promo plan attracts the highest number of new users/subscribers and analyze their demographics.
   - Identify the promo plan more popular among females.
   
4. **Month with Minimum Number of Badges Received:**
   - Identify the month with the minimum number of badges received.

By applying analytics techniques such as segmentation, calculation, and comparison, actionable insights will be derived from the data using visualization techniques.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide Gameflix with valuable insights into the effectiveness of its promotional strategies, allowing for informed decision-making and optimization of future marketing efforts in the Indian market.
